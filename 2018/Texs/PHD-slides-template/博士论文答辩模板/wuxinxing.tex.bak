基于语言建立软件可信性度量\textcolor[rgb]{0.70,0.00,0.00}{理论}, \textcolor[rgb]{0.70,0.00,0.00}{应用}到基于结构化程序设计语言的软件、构件的软件和BPEL的Web服务可信性度量的研究, 使用Ruby/Tk 开发可信性度量\textcolor[rgb]{0.70,0.00,0.00}{工具}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item<2-5> 随机-混成进程代数可信性量化

将此理论方法应用到基于结构化程序设计语言的软件和基于BPEL语言的 Web 服务可信性度量的研究
\item<3-5> 概率拟 Hoare 逻辑

将此理论应用到基于构件的软件可信性度量的研究
\item<4-5> Web服务降级替换可信性量化理论

\begin{slide}[method=direct]{进一步工作}
\begin{itemize}
\item 有关度量理论和模型的原子构造可信度只是理论上的, 接下来我们将进一步考虑通过具体的方法在实际中来估计原子构造的可信度.

\item 丰富可信性度量规则, 进一步考虑对软件可信性的动态分析和度量以及测试其作为可信性度量工具自身的可信性.
