## Description
This repository contains self-made Solarized Dark/Light themes for TeXstudio. To use them, simply replace the `[formats]` section found in your TeXstudio settings file with code of preferred theme.

Highlighting schemes for dtx/Sweave/Pweave/Asymptote/Lua/QtScript editing are also included, though I rarely use them so there may be some inconsistencies. Both themes are tested with current version (2.12.0) of TeXstudio.

Don't forget to make a copy of your current highlighting scheme in case you want to switch back later.
